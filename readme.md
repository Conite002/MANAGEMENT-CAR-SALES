# INTRODUCTION
This project aims to create an interactive dashboard for car sales analysis. The main objective is to provide an overview of business performance using various key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts. This dashboard allows users to track sales in real time, analyze weekly, monthly and annual trends, and compare results to the previous year.

The analysis focuses on three main aspects: sales overview, average price analysis, and metrics related to cars sold. Each section provides essential insights to understand overall sales performance, price variations, and sales distribution by region, body style, and car color
